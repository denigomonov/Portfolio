# Project (AUG/2020): COVID-19 U.S. Dashboard
* Created _inline & external_ dynamic dashboards breaking down the spread of Covid-19 in U.S. using Python & Jupyter
* Prepared and transformed data read from [USAFACTS](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/)
* Optimized OLS Regression for Covid-19 Case & Death 2-Week predictions
* Engineered features and built custom plots for metric analysis, geo-mapping and forecasting via Plotly
* Launched _external_ version of the dashboard using (to be continued...)
