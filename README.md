# Project (AUG/2020): COVID-19 U.S. Dashboard
* Created _inline & external_ dynamic dashboards breaking down the spread of Covid-19 in U.S. using Python & Jupyter
* Prepared and transformed data read from [USAFACTS](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/)
* Optimized OLS Regression for Covid-19 Case & Death 2-Week predictions
* Engineered features and built custom plots for metric analysis, geo-mapping and forecasting via Plotly
* Launched _external_ version of the dashboard using (to be continued...)

# Project (JUN/2020): Advanced Iris Species EDA
* Created EDA-Notebook exploring uncommon visualization techniques for Iris Species using Python & Jupyter
* Explored _petal & sepal_ features with customized Scatter, Coordinates and Categorical-Coordinates plots
* Determined features and applied K-Nearest-Neighbors classification with best model fit & performance via Scikit-learn
* Visualized KNN-algorithm output and its decision boundary in 2D format with Countour plot
